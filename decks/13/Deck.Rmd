# Forced oscillations

## Inhomogeneous equations

- Unforced or *free* vibrations are controlled by the
differential equation
\begin{equation*}
    mu'' + \gamma u' + ku = 0.
\end{equation*}

When external forces are present, we typically add them together and regard
them as the inhomogeneous term in the equation
\begin{equation*}
    mu'' + \gamma u' + ku = F(t).
\end{equation*}

## Good news

- We solve this equation for a large class of forcing
functions $F(t)$ using the methods of undetermined coefficients and variation
of parameters.

- FYI: other methods exist, in particular the method of *Laplace transforms*,
that are even better suited to *discontinuous* forcing functions such as
square waves.

## What else is there to say?

- In the free damped case ($F(t) = 0,\, \gamma > 0$), the
displacement decays to zero with increasing time. 
- Therefore, we think about the general solution of the forced, damped 
equation as the sum of two pieces:
\begin{equation*}
    y_c + Y
\end{equation*}
- Since $y_c \to 0$ as $t \to \infty$, $y_c$ is called the
*transient* part of the solution, and $Y$ the *steady-state* solution.

## Transient and steady-state

Recall also that in solving an instance of this equation, the coefficients
$c_1$ and $c_2$ are determined only by the initial conditions, and the steady-
state solution is independent of them.

\begin{block}{Dual nature of solutions}
    The forcing function alone determines the steady-state solution; initial
    conditions only affect the transient.
\end{block}

## Beats: when frequencies are near

- Suppose the forcing function is sinusoidal
    - with frequency close to the natural (undamped) frequency $\omega_0$.
- Let $\omega$ be the forcing frequency and $F_0$ the forcing amplitude, so 
that $F(t) = F_0 \cos{(\omega t)}$. The equation of motion becomes
\begin{equation*}
    u'' + \omega_0^2 u = \frac{F_0}{m} \cos{(\omega t)}.
\end{equation*}
- UC: Particular solution should be $Y = A \cos{(\omega t)} + B 
\sin{(\omega t)}$. But in fact one can show that $B = 0$.

## Beats: the particular solution

- Furthermore, one can show that $A = \frac{F_0/m}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}$, so that 
\begin{equation*}
    u = c_1 \cos{(\omega_0 t)} + c_2 \sin{(\omega_0 t)} + \frac{F_0/m}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2} \cos{(\omega t)}.
\end{equation*}
- If the system starts from equilibrium, one can show[^ex1] that 
\begin{equation*}
    c_1 = -\frac{F_0/m}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}, \quad c_2 = 0.
\end{equation*}
- The displacement function is thus determined to be
\begin{equation*}
    u = \frac{F_0/m}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2} \left( \cos{(\omega t)} - \cos{(\omega_0 t)} \right).
\end{equation*}

## We got the beat

We now use the trigonometric identity 
\begin{equation*}
    \cos{(\alpha - \beta)} - \cos{(\alpha + \beta)} = 2 \sin \alpha \sin \beta
\end{equation*}
to rewrite this as
\begin{equation*}
    u(t) = \left( \frac{2F_0/m}{\omega_0^2 - \omega^2} \sin{\frac{\omega_0 - \omega}{2} t} \right) \sin{\frac{\omega_0 + \omega}{2} t}.
\end{equation*}

- We can interpret the equation as a fast oscillation *modulated* by a slow
one, since $\omega_0 \approx \omega$.

## Resonance

- What happens when $\omega_0 = \omega$? 
- Roughly speaking, the period of the
slow oscillation becomes infinite. 
- We see a steadily
increasing amplitude for the fast oscillation. 
- The differential equation is
degenerate, and the particular solution ends up being

\begin{equation*}
    Y = \frac{F_0}{2m \omega_0}t \sin{(\omega_0 t)}.
\end{equation*}
- If $u(0) = u'(0) = 0$, then $c_1 = c_2 = 0$. Displacement is
\begin{equation*}
    u = Y = \frac{F_0}{2m \omega_0}t \sin{(\omega_0 t)}.
\end{equation*}
- Observe that $\lim_{t \to \infty} u = \infty$, as advertised.

## An explanation

``The following argument may shed some light on resonance phenomena. A system
has the minimum resistance to oscillations at its natural frequency
$\omega_0$, since it will oscillate at $\omega_0$ when it is not disturbed.
When an external effect forces the system to oscillate at a different
frequency, the system will resist because it does not feel comfortable
oscillating at an unnatural frequency. But when the external effect forces
the system to oscillate at its natural frequency, the system will gladly
cooperate since the request is in perfect compliance with its intrinsic
characteristics.''
