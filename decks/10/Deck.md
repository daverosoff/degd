# Introduction

## Introduction: This one goes out to all the $g$s

The method of undetermined coefficients is very useful when the derivatives of
the terms appearing in $g(t)$ have a regular, predictable shape and are
themselves the derivatives of similar functions. But it's not too hard to find
functions $g(t)$ that would demand excessive ingenuity of us when guessing the
form of $Y$.

## Introduction: Too many functions!

Consider $y'' + y' + y = 3 \csc{(t)}$. You can check that a particular
solution $Y$ is given by the formula
    \begin{equation*}
        \only<2>{-3 \sin{(t)} \cos{(2t)} + \frac{3}{2} \ln |\csc{(t)} - \cot{(t)}| 
        \sin{(2t)} + 3 \cos{(t)} \sin{(2t)}.}
    \end{equation*}
    
It's hard to imagine rules for undetermined coefficients that are both

- comprehensive enough to include a function like this and
- possible to commit to memory.


# Variation of parameters

## Variation of parameters: not a new thought

- How did we find $t e^{rt}$ in the case of a repeated root $r$ of 
the characteristic equation? 
- We promoted a constant to a function and looked for a solution of the form
$v(t) \exp{(rt)}$.

- In other words, we allowed a \textcolor{red}{parameter} to \textcolor{red}{vary}.

- VP is the same idea, adapted to equation $y'' +
q(t)y' + r(t)y = g(t)$
    - Requires that we have already solved the associated homogeneous equation
$y'' + q(t)y' + r(t)y = 0$. 
    - So assume we know $y_1$ and $y_2$ with $W(y_1,y_2) \ne 0$.

## Variation of parameters: execution

- Guess: $Y = u_1 y_1 + u_2 y_2$ where $u_1, u_2$ are functions of $t$:

\begin{equation*}
    Y(t) = u_1(t) y_1(t) + u_2(t) y_2(t),
\end{equation*}

- Goal: solve for $u_1$, $u_2$.
We'll be plugging this expression for $Y$ along with its derivatives back into
the inhomogeneous equation, so let's compute the derivatives now.

## An unjustified assumption

- Assume that the fundamental solutions $y_1$ and
$y_2$ and the derivatives $u'_1$ and $u'_2$ satisfy the following equation:
\begin{equation*}
    u'_1 y_1 + u'_2 y_2  = 0.
\end{equation*}

> - This is the worst rabbit-out-of-the-hat of the term. 
> - Sorry. 
> - The idea is evidently due to Lagrange[^lag], and it greatly simplifies the 
computation to come. 
> - At no point does it cause problems of any kind.

## The derivatives of $Y$

Since
\begin{equation*}
    Y(t) = u_1(t) y_1(t) + u_2(t) y_2(t),
\end{equation*}
we also have
\begin{align*}
    Y'  &= \textcolor{blue}{u'_1 y_1} + u_1 y'_1 + 
            \textcolor{blue}{u'_2 y_2} + u_2 y'_2, \quad \text{\textcolor{blue}{blue terms}
            add to 0}\\
        &= u_1 y'_1 + u_2 y'_2, \quad \text{and so} \\
    Y'' &= u_1 y''_1 + u'_1 y'_1 + u'_2 y'_2 + u_2 y''_2.
\end{align*}

## Substitute back in

Now we find that $Y''(t) + q(t)Y'(t) + r(t)Y(t)$ reduces to
\begin{equation*}
    (u_1 y''_1 + u'_1 y'_1 + u'_2 y'_2 + u_2 y''_2) + q(t)(u_1 y'_1 + u_2 y'_2)
    + r(t)(u_1 y_1 + u_2 y_2).
\end{equation*}
Collecting terms along $u_1$, $u_2$, and their derivatives, we get
\begin{align*}
    (y''_1  & + qy'_1 + ry_1)u_1 + (y''_2 + qy'_2 + ry_2)u_2 + y'_1 u'_1 + y'_2 u'_2 \\
    &= y'_1 u'_1 + y'_2 u'_2,
\end{align*}
because of the assumption $u'_1 y_1 + u'_2 y_2  = 0$.

## Putting it all together

We have shown that if $u_1$ and $u_2$ have the desired properties, then they satisfy
\begin{align*}
    u'_1 y'_1 + u'_2 y'_2 &= g(t) \\
    u'_1 y_1 + u'_2 y_2  &= 0.
\end{align*}
Solving this system of equations for $u_1$ and $u_2$ (in the usual algebraic way, by 
either substitution or addition of equations) gives
\begin{equation*}
    u'_1 = -\frac{y_2 g}{W(y_1, y_2)}, u'_2 = \frac{y_1 g}{W(y_1, y_2)}.
\end{equation*}
Integrating each of these yields the desired functions $u_1$ and $u_2$.

# Conclusion

## The particular solution
That is, a particular solution $Y$ results from any choice of antiderivatives $u_1$, $u_2$. We have
\begin{equation*}
    Y = -y_1 \int \frac{y_2 g}{W(y_1, y_2)} \; dt + y_2 \int \frac{y_1 g}{W(y_1, y_2)} \; dt.
\end{equation*}
Like undetermined coefficients, this method has its own characteristics.

- It is reassuringly mechanistic. $Y$ is given by a formula.
- It is also very general, since there are no conditions on $g$.
- On the other hand, the integrals that arise may be intractable.

## Generalizations
For us, the coefficient functions $q(t)$ and $r(t)$ are constant. What happens when they are not?

- The methods of Chapter 5 are required to solve the general second-order linear homogeneous equation. 
- If fundamental solutions are known, VP works just the same to determine a particular solution. 
- It is only the characteristic equation and the exponential trick that fail in this case.
