\begin{questions}

\question Find the roots of the characteristic equation for the differential equation $y'' + 9y = 0$. Note that the discriminant is negative, so they are complex. Call them $r_1$ and $r_2$.

\dwrspace{1}

\question Evaluate $(r_1 + r_2)/2$ and $(r_1 - r_2)/2i$. What do you notice about these numbers?

\dwrspace{1}

\question What complex exponential functions solve the differential equation? Use the roots you found and ape the exponential trick from before. (You want two different functions, $u_1$ and $u_2$, with no $c_1$ or $c_2$.)

\question Write these functions using Euler's formula. Use the identities 
$\sin{(-x)} = -\sin{(x)}$ and $\cos{(-x)} = \cos{(x)}$ to simplify.

\question Write down $y_1 = (u_1 + u_2)/2$ and $y_2 = (u_1 - u_2)/2i$ and simplify. What do you notice?

\newpage

\question Apply the method to each differential equation, obtaining two independent \emph{real-valued} solutions. (Independent means the Wronskian is nonzero.) Remember:
\begin{equation*}
e^{(x + iy)t} = e^{xt}e^{iyt}
\end{equation*}

\begin{parts}
    
    \part $y'' + 2y' + 8y = 0$

    \dwrspace{1}

    \part $3y'' + 6y' + 4y = 0$

    \dwrspace{1}

    \part $6y'' - 8y' + 10y = 0$

    \dwrspace{1}


\end{parts}
