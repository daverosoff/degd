\question Consider the differential equation
\begin{equation*}
    y'' = -y.
\end{equation*}
Think about the familiar functions until you spot a solution. Compare with the
people around you. You should be able to find two really ``different''
solutions. Call them $y_1$ and $y_2$. Remember, when we say that $y_1$ is a
\emph{solution} to the differential equation, we mean that substitution of
$y_1$ for $y$ makes the equation true.

\question Check (by substitution) that $c_1 y_1$ and $c_2
y_2$ for arbitrary constants $c_1 $ and $c_2 $ are also solutions to $y'' = 
-y$, for the functions $y_1$ and $y_2$ defined above.

\question Substitute to check that $c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2$ is yet another
solution to $y'' = -y$.

\question Initial value problems look a little different for second-order
equations. Since there is a 2-dimensional family of solutions, we need 2
initial conditions to pick one out. These most frequently take the form

\begin{equation*}
    y(0) = y_0, \quad y'(0) = y'_0.
\end{equation*}

Find a solution to the initial value problem $y'' = -y$, $y(0) = 1$, $y'(0) =
0$ by plugging in $c_1 y_1 + c_2y_2$ for $y$ and using the initial conditions
to find $c_1 $ and $c_2$. How many solutions of this form are there?

\question Let $r \ne 0$ and consider the function $y = e^{rt}$. Find $y'$ and
$y''$, and write $ay'' + by' + cy$ in terms of $y$ (i.e., find an equivalent
expression with no primes). You should be able to factor $y$ out of the
expression you find.

\question Now consider the differential equation $ay'' + by' + cy = 0$. Assume
that this equation has a solution of the form $y = e^{rt}$, and use the result of
the previous part to express $r$ in terms of $a$, $b$, $c$.

\question Find two really ``different'' solutions to the differential equation
$y'' - y' - 6y = 0$. Call them $y_1$ and $y_2$.

\dwrspace{1}

\question The linear combination $c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2$ is called the general solution
of $y'' - y' - 6y = 0$. Can you use it to solve the initial value problem
$y'' - y' - 6y = 0$, $y(0) = 2$, $y'(0) = -5$?
