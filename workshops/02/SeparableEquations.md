\begin{questions}

    \question Solve the initial value problem $\dfrac{dy}{dx} = 2xy^2$, 
    $y(2) = 1$.
    \begin{parts}
        \part Divide both sides by $y^2$ to put the equation in standard form.

        \dwrspace{1}

        \part Integrate each side with respect to the evident variable. (This is
        justified by appeal to $u$-substitution: $dy = y' \; dx$.)

        \dwrspace{2}

        \part You should now have an equation that is free of derivatives, but with
        a constant of integration. Plug in the initial values to find the value
        of this constant.

        \dwrspace{1}

        \part If possible, solve your equation for $y$.

    \question Solve the initial value problem $1 + ye^{-x} y' = 0$, $y(0) = 1$.


    \dwrspace{2}

    \question Find solutions to the differential equation
    \begin{equation*}
        y' = \frac{3x^2 + 4x + 2}{2(y-1)}.
    \end{equation*}
    
    \dwrspace{1}

    \question Consider the initial value problem $y' = 5y^2$, $y(0) = y_0$.
    For what values of $y_0$ does the solution have a vertical asymptote at $y = 6$
    and a $t$-interval of existence $-\infty < t < 6$?
