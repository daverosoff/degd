% Math 352 Schedule of Topics: Spring 2014

Here, you can find a rough guide to what was discussed in class on any
particular day. If you missed class, you can also find workshop handouts
and other materials here. You should also find a classmate who will share
more specific notes from the days you were unable to attend.

Weekly problem sets are [listed separately][weekly], as are [WeBWorK problems][ww]. 

To import a Sage worksheet into SageMathCloud, first download the worksheet file
to your local machine from a link below. Then, open a new Sage Worksheet. Drag
the downloaded file right onto the Worksheet pane and it should come right up.
Then you can modify your local copy in the cloud and it will be synced and saved
automatically.
