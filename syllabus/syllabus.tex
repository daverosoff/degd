    I explicitly include these outcomes in the syllabus so that it is clear
    why I have chosen the various course components (each of which is
    described below.) Each learning outcome is addressed by one or more
    components of the course: quizzes, WeBWorK exercises, longer weekly problem sets,
    presentations to the class, and exams.

\subsection{Introduction}

If you are considering a life as any kind of engineer, physical scientist, or
applied mathematician, life is differential equations. The laws of the
universe are all differential equations: problems involving fluid flow,
current in electric circuits, population dynamics, pricing of financial
derivatives,\footnote{Financial derivatives are unrelated to the derivatives of
calculus.} quantum mechanics, heat transfer, relativity, etc., are all
formulated in this language. They are ubiquitous and of paramount importance.
I assume this is reason enough for you to be interested.

Here is a bit of mathematical philosophy. Numbers and points are the same.
Ordinary numbers are points on a line; points in other spaces are different
kinds of numbers. If the space the points live in is a Euclidean space like
$\R^2$ or $\R^3$, these numbers are often called \emph{vectors}. You have
spent many years solving equations involving both constants and variables
whose values are ordinary numbers, and maybe a few weeks solving equations
involving vectors. Usually, we refer to this kind of work as \emph{algebra}.

Points, and therefore numbers, are zero-dimensional.\footnote{Think of the head
of the vector, not the whole arrow.} They are pure locations. They do not
have extent of any kind. A one-dimensional number is called a \emph{curve}.
You can also think of a curve as a family of points, as we often do in
calculus. These points are related—as are the members of any family. Often,
they are related by an equation defining the curve. Many algebraic problems
involve finding a special point on a curve: a special member of a family.

Differential equations also involve both constants and variables and need to
be solved. But here, the constants, variables, and solutions are all 
one-dimensional: they are curves! Solutions are called the integral curves 
of the differential
equation or equations. The solution of differential equations is the
understanding of the algebra of curves. Usually, the plane will be partitioned
into a bunch of related curves that fit together in a family—related, just as
in algebra, by an equation (now, a differential equation) defining the family.
Many problems in differential equations involve finding a special curve in a
family. These are called \emph{initial value problems}. As in algebra, most
equations cannot be solved. Equations that admit exact solutions are very
special. We will investigate some of the elementary equations and classify
them according to their form. We will also discuss systems of linear
differential equations, which are solved via linear-algebraic techniques
involving matrices.

\subsection{Catalog description}

“A study of the solution and applications of ordinary differential equations
including systems of equations using matrix algebra.”

\subsection{Text}

The text is \emph{Elementary Differential Equations} by Boyce
and DiPrima, ninth edition. This book and its cousins have been the standard
for two generations, so the world is awash in earlier editions (as well as
one much more expensive later edition). I don't recommend you use an edition
earlier than the eighth. If you have an earlier edition of the text than the
ninth, that is fine: but ascertaining the differences in the texts,
especially differently numbered or new homework problems, \emph{will be your
sole responsibility}. The same caveat applies to any international version.
Websites exist that catalog differences between versions.

\subsection{Grading}

Scores%
    \sidenote{\centering\smallcaps{Table of weights}
        \begin{tabular}{lc}
            \toprule
            Tier & Weight \\
            \midrule
            WeBWorK       & 0.10 \\
            Workshops     & 0.05 \\
            Weeklies      & 0.05 \\
            Quizzes       & 0.35 \\

            Two midterms  & 0.20 \\
            Final         & 0.20 \\

    }%
are computed as a weighted average, with the weights indicated in the
margin. Descriptions of the various tiers follow. 
Observe that the weights sum to 1 = 100\%. The exact determination of letter
grades from these scores depends on the final distribution of scores in the
class, but you can expect a C for earning 73\% of the points, a C+ for
77\%, a B– for 80\%, and so on. I may adjust these cutoffs downward, but
I will not adjust them upward.

\subsection{Homework}

Both WeBWorK and traditional pencil-and-paper homework will be assigned.
WeBWorK exercises are shorter and more procedural, helping you assess your
own understanding of the ideas of the course. The weekly homework sets, 
which are longer, are more involved problems. Some problems 
may take you several hours, or require some work with a computer algebra
system such as Sage, Mathematica, or Matlab.%
    \sidenote{
        I believe that in fact it is possible to do all of the problems by
        hand, but some would be very laborious without computer assistance.
    }
My goal is as follows: every
student who successfully completes all of the homework problems and
\emph{understands all the solutions} should be able to earn an A in this
course. All quizzes and exams are designed with this in mind. Therefore, I
hope you will agree that it is in your very best interest to complete all of
the assigned work, regardless of whether it is turned in for credit. The
course is designed so that you will do best if you work at a modest but
constant pace throughout the term. Cramming might work too, but not as
well—and not as permanently, which is really the point.

\subsection{A note on written homework}

Even it you are not turning it in, it is important to pay attention to the
style of your writing and your presentation. Good mathematical writing is
essential for anyone who wishes to think clearly about mathematics—sloppy
writing \emph{invariably} reflects underlying sloppy thinking. The process of
making your ideas and reasoning \emph{clear, complete, and unambiguously
correct} is the greatest amplifier of mathematical power there is. Hence
your solutions should be composed in brilliant English prose.%
    \sidenote{
        This means conforming to accepted
        scientific usage, more or less correct grammar and spelling, and above all
        \emph{complete sentences}, sprinkled with equations here and there. Solutions
        in the popular “pile-of-equations” style are to be avoided and will not get
        much credit.
    }% 
You must explain what is happening as the action unfolds. You should also
avoid falling into a “two-column” format that you may have learned in a 
high-school geometry class. It is stilted, artificial, and not easier to read than
a pile of equations. Weave text and equations together for a gentle
presentation that doesn't leave the reader guessing.

\subsection{Quizzes}

Quizzes will be given frequently to help you make sure you are staying on top
of the material. Quiz problems will come directly, or nearly so, from the
assigned daily WeBWorK problems. Quizzes begin promptly at 8:00 and can not be
made up.

\subsection{Workshops}

Most of you are familiar with the workshop format from Calculus~III. Workshops
are primarily in-class activities (although some will need to be finished at home)
in which you will work through some aspects of a problem with other students in
the class. Along with the homework, the workshops are the heart of the course.

\subsection{Exam dates}

As specified below, you will take two in-class exams as well as the
traditional comprehensive final exam. Let me know \emph{immediately} if you
foresee a conflict. See below also for information regarding make-up exams.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Exam~1 (tentative): Monday, March~3
   \item Exam~2 (tentative): Wednesday, April~9
   \item Final Exam: Wednesday, May~15, 1:30–4:30
\end{itemize}
%
\subsection{Make-ups}

I will only consider make-up exams with a \emph{documented, compelling reason}
and sufficient (two weeks is always enough) notice; otherwise, remaining exams
will be reweighted.  Quizzes can not be made up.

\subsection{Academic integrity}

Students are expected to complete all graded work in accordance with the
College Honor Code. Plagiarism, cheating, or borrowing without proper credit
will not be tolerated.  Violations of academic honesty can result in loss of
credit on an assignment, failure on an exam, or failure in the course. A
referral may be made to the Vice President for Academic Affairs for all
parties involved in academic dishonesty.

\subsection{A note on studying math}

This class is all about practice. Learning to recognize the different types of
equations and quickly and accurately recall the procedures needed to solve
them is a matter of rote technique. If you have practiced enough, you will
remember how to do it.\footnote{This is the definition of “enough”.} If not,
something else may happen. Of course, there are deep ideas lurking beneath the
computational techniques. Awareness and understanding of these ideas also
comes with practice.

\subsection{Disability statement}

Students with documented disabilities as addressed by the Americans With
Disabilities Act and who need any test or course materials to be furnished in
an alternative format should notify me immediately (during the first week of
class).  Reasonable efforts will be made to accommodate the needs of such
students.
