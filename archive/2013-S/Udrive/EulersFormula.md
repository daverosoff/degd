### A note on Euler's formula

Generations of math students have shivered in ecstasy while contemplating Euler's most famous equation,
\\[
e^{i \theta} = \cos{\theta} + i \sin{\theta}.
\\]
It is hard to justify rigorously without developing quite a bit of machinery of analytic functions, the objects of study in complex analysis. In this short note, I explain the interpretation of complex arithmetic which allows for an intuitive understanding of why Euler's formula must be true, without using too much calculus. I will use vector geometry only. [Read these lecture notes][cplx-ln1] from the Complex Analysis course and then return to this page, referring back to the notes as necessary.
