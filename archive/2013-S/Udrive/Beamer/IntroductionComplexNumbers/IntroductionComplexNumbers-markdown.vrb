A historical quotation on Euler's formula:

 \begin{block}{Benjamin Peirce (1809--1880)}

\begin{verbatim}
"Gentlemen, that is surely true,
it is absolutely paradoxical;
we cannot understand it,
and we don't know what it means.
But we have proved it,
and therefore we know it must be the truth."
\end{verbatim}


 \end{block}
