<p>\begin{frame}{This week so far}</p>

<p>This week, we&#8217;ve been investigating the second-order homogeneous equation
[
 ay&#8217;&#8217; + by&#8217; + cy = 0.
]</p>

<p>\begin{itemize}
 \item Monday, we saw how to find solutions of exponential type $y = ce^{rt}$. The growth constants $r$ that ``work&#8217;&#8217; are the roots of the characteristic equation $ar^2 + br + c = 0$.
 \pause
 \item When $b^2 - 4ac &gt; 0$ (the characteristic polynomial has \emph{positive discriminant}), we get two values $r_1$ and $r_2$.
 \pause
 \item Hence we obtain two solutions, $y_1 = e^{r_1 t}$ and $y_2 = e^{r_2 t}$.
\end{itemize}</p>

<p>\end{frame}</p>

<p>\begin{frame}{Recap}</p>

<p>We also know that solutions of \emph{linear homogeneous equations} can be linearly combined to get more solutions. Therefore, we have a 2-dimensional family of solutions
[
 c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2.
]</p>

<p>\begin{block}{Exercise}
Use the Wronskian to show that when $b^2 - 4ac &gt; 0$, the solutions $y_1$ and $y_2$ described above generate all solutions to $ay&#8217;&#8217; + by&#8217; + cy = 0$.
\end{block}</p>

<p>\end{frame}</p>

<p>\begin{frame}{Negative discriminant}</p>

<p>None of this tells what happens when $b^2 - 4ac &lt; 0$. The existence theorem still applies, so the solutions have to be out there somewhere. If we expand our thinking to the realm of \emph{complex numbers}, we can get them using the same trick.</p>

<p>\begin{block}{Definition}
 A \emph{complex number} is a symbol $x + iy$, where $x$ and $y$ are ordinary (i.e., real) numbers. We adopt two conventions:
 \begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
 \item these numbers obey all the rules of arithmetic;
 \item $i^2 + 1 = 0$.
 \end{inparaenum}
 \end{block}</p>

<p>\end{frame}</p>

<p>\begin{frame}{Why bother?}</p>

<p>Our polynomial trick relies on getting the roots of $ar^2 + br + c = 0$. They only exist in the extended algebraic system of complex numbers. You are probably aware that polynomials such as $x^2 + 9 = 0$ admit solutions in the complex numbers. There is a somewhat more general statement to make.</p>

<p>\begin{block}{Theorem}
 (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.) Each polynomial of degree $n$ with complex coefficients has exactly $n$ complex roots, counting multiplicities. Equivalently, each such polynomial splits over the complex numbers into $n$ (not necessarily distinct) linear factors.
 \end{block}</p>

<p>This theorem was known to Euler, but it is widely asserted that the first satisfactory proofs were due to Gauss (1777&#8211;1855). </p>

<p>\end{frame}</p>

<p>\section{Polynomials over $\C$}</p>

<p>\begin{frame}{Getting solutions}</p>

<p>The quadratic formula works in complete generality in the complex context. We will always assume that $a$, $b$, and $c$ (the coefficients in our differential equation) are real. This avoids some interesting difficulties with the complex square root. Observe that if $D &lt; 0$, then $D = -|D| = i^2 |D|$.</p>

<p>\begin{block}{Square roots of negative numbers}
 We agree to interpret (when $D = b^2 - 4ac &lt; 0$) the symbol $\sqrt{D}$ as:
 [
 \sqrt{D} = \sqrt{i^2 |D|} = i \sqrt{|D|}.
 ]
 \end{block}</p>

<p>\end{frame}</p>

<p>\section{The complex exponential function}</p>

<p>\begin{frame}{The complex exponential}</p>

<p>Once we have obtained our two complex roots $r_1$ and $r_2$, we need to interpret the corresponding exponential solutions.
 \pause
 \begin{block}{WTF?}
 What&#8217;s $e^{rt}$ when $r$ is complex?
 \end{block}</p>

<p>The answer is found in what is called Euler&#8217;s formula.
\end{frame}</p>

<p>\begin{frame}{Euler&#8217;s formula}</p>

<p>A historical quotation on Euler&#8217;s formula:</p>

<p>\begin{block}{Benjamin Peirce (1809&#8211;1880)}
 ``Gentlemen, that is surely true,
it is absolutely paradoxical;
we cannot understand it,
and we don&#8217;t know what it means.
But we have proved it,
and therefore we know it must be the truth.&#8217;&#8217;
 \end{block}</p>

<p>\end{frame}</p>

<p>\begin{frame}{Euler&#8217;s formula}</p>

<p>Since $r$ is complex, it is a symbol of the form $x + iy$. Therefore, since $t$ is real, we get</p>

<p>[
 e^{rt} = e^{(x+iy)t} = e^{xt} e^{iyt}.
 ]</p>

<p>This is assuming the addition law for a function we haven&#8217;t really defined, but if it didn&#8217;t obey the addition law, we couldn&#8217;t bear to call it the exponential function.
\end{frame}</p>

<p>\begin{frame}{Euler&#8217;s formula}</p>

<p>This famous and celebrated equation tells us how to interpret the $e^{iyt}$ portion of our exponential expression.</p>

<p>\begin{block}{Euler&#8217;s formula}
 [e^{i \theta} = \cos{\theta} + i \sin{\theta}]
 \end{block}</p>

<p>Thus $\exp(rt) = \exp(xt + iyt) = e^{xt}(\cos{(yt)} + i \sin{(yt)})$.</p>

<p>\end{frame}</p>

<p>\begin{frame}{Euler&#8217;s formula}
 Putting $\theta = \pi$, we obtain a special case, often referred to as Euler&#8217;s formula.</p>

<p>\begin{block}{Also Euler&#8217;s formula}
 [ e^{\pi i} = &#8211;1. ]
