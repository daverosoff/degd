<h3 id="thenondegeneratecase">The nondegenerate case</h3>

<p>Last week, we saw how to use the <!--
\textsc{-->Method of Undetermined Coefficients<!--}
--> to find particular solutions of the inhomogeneous equation
<span class="math">\[
    ay'' + by' + cy = g(t),
\]</span>
when <span class="math">\( g(t) \)</span> is a polynomial, an exponential function, or a linear combination of sines and cosines (with like frequencies).</p>

<p>Our findings are summarized in the next table, and should be memorized.</p>

<h3 id="theshapeofyforsimpleg">The shape of <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> for simple <span class="math">\( g \)</span></h3>

<p>We saw too that if <span class="math">\( g(t) \)</span> is a linear combination of the above forms, then an appropriate guess for <span class="math">\( Y \)</span> is a linear combination (with suitably generalized coefficients) of the corresponding entries in the second column. For example, <span class="math">\( g(t) = 3t^2 + \exp{(2t)} \)</span> would lead to the form
<span class="math">\[
    Y(t) = At^2 + Bt + C + D \exp{(2t)}.
\]</span></p>

<h2 id="adaptationsvariantsanddegeneracy">Adaptations, variants, and degeneracy</h2>

<h3 id="efficiencyinchoosingtheformofy">Efficiency in choosing the form of <span class="math">\( Y \)</span></h3>

<p>The table is given in (almost) the most abbreviated form. That means there is a lot of opportunity to waste time, if you are not paying attention to what you&#8217;re doing. Suppose <span class="math">\( g(t) = 3t^3 + t^4 \)</span>. Each of these is a polynomial, so a suitable choice for <span class="math">\( Y(t) \)</span> could be
<span class="math">\[
    Y(t) = \underbrace{At^3 + Bt^2 + Ct + D}_{\text{from $3t^3$}} + \underbrace{Et^4 + Ft^3 + Gt^2 + Ht + I}_{\text{from $t^4$}}.
\]</span>
The problem here is that this is very inefficient. It is a large system of equations awaiting you, with many solutions (rather than just one). </p>

<h3 id="howtobeefficient">How to be efficient</h3>

<p>The reason is that this polynomial is a disguised version of
<span class="math">\[
    Y(t) = At^4 + Bt^3 + Ct^2 + Dt + E
\]</span>
which is what you get if you regard <span class="math">\( g(t) \)</span> as a single polynomial, rather than as a linear combination. Always think of <span class="math">\( g(t) \)</span> in the way that leads to the fewest terms in the linear combination.</p>

<h3 id="products">Products</h3>

<p>There are similar improvements to be made when confronted with an inhomogeneous term that is a product of the atomic ones, for example
<span class="math">\[
    g(t) = \exp{(2t)} \sin{(t)}.
\]</span>
Now the na&iuml;<!--\"i-->ve guess is <span class="math">\( Y = A \exp{(2t)} \sin{(t)} \)</span>, but having been burned before we know better and write down the product of <em>the corresponding table entries</em>,
<span class="math">\[
    Y(t) = (A \exp{(2t)}) (B \cos{(t)} + C \sin{(t)}).
\]</span>
This looks more promising, and an expansion gives
<span class="math">\[
    Y(t) = AB \exp{(2t)} \cos{(t)} + AC \exp{(2t)} \sin{(t)}.
\]</span></p>

<h3 id="relabelorreorganize">Relabel or reorganize</h3>

<p>It is essential to remember that only the <em>form</em> of <span class="math">\( Y \)</span> matters, not the names we give to its coefficients. Thus <span class="math">\( AB \)</span> and <span class="math">\( AC \)</span> should just be relabeled. It&#8217;s OK to reuse the letters, so you could write
<span class="math">\[
    Y(t) = A \exp{(2t)} \sin{(t)} + B \exp{(2t)} \cos{(t)}.
\]</span>
This is more efficient because it is a <em>smaller</em> system with <em>fewer</em> solutions.</p>

<p>Another conceptual approach is to think about exponential factors separately. Observe that <span class="math">\( Y \)</span> in the previous display is the product of the <em>original</em> exponential from <span class="math">\( g \)</span> with the <em>prescribed guess</em> for the trignonometric factor. This &#8220;works&#8221; with polynomials also. </p>

<h3 id="trytheseout">Try these out</h3>

<p>Write down the most efficient form for <span class="math">\( Y \)</span> that you can, for each of these instances of <span class="math">\( g(t) \)</span>.</p>

<!--
\[
    e^{7t} (2 \cos{(2t)} - 8 \sin{(2t)}) \only<2>{ \implies A e^{7t} \cos{(2t)} + B e^{7t} \sin{(2t)} }
\] \[
    t^2 e^{2t} \only<2>{ \implies A t^2 e^{2t} + B t e^{2t} + C e^{2t}} 
\] \[
    3t^3 \sin{5t} \only<2>{\quad \text{...shown on the next slide.}}
\]

\begin{align*}
At^3 \cos{(5t)} &+ Bt^3 \sin{(5t)} + Ct^2 \cos{(5t)} + Dt^2 \sin{(5t)} \\ 
&+ Et \cos{(5t)} + Ft \sin{(5t)} + G \cos{(5t)} + H \sin{(5t)}
\end{align*}
-->

<p>This results in an <span class="math">\( 8 \times 8 \)</span> system of equations, which I wouldn&#8217;t ask you to solve by hand. We&#8217;ll see how to solve them using Sage in a couple of weeks.</p>

<h3 id="degeneracy">Degeneracy</h3>

<p>One question remains that we haven&#8217;t gone into: what to do when part of the complementary solution <span class="math">\( c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2 \)</span> appears in <span class="math">\( g(t) \)</span>?
<span class="math">\[
    y'' + 5y' + 6y = 6e^{-2t}
\]</span>
No choice of <span class="math">\( A \)</span> will make <span class="math">\( Y = A \exp{(-2t)} \)</span> a solution to the above inhomogeneous equation, because such a function is a solution to the <em>associated homogeneous equation</em>. In such cases, guided either by past experience or divine inspiration, one uses a higher-degree polynomial. Let the coefficient be <span class="math">\( At \)</span> rather than <span class="math">\( A \)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="adegeneratesolution">A degenerate solution</h3>

<p>Here, you can check that <span class="math">\( 6t \exp{(-2t)} \)</span> is a solution. It is found by the same method as usual. But wait, you say!
<!-- \pause -->
What if we consider the equation <span class="math">\( y'' + 4y' + 4y = 6 \exp{(-2t)} \)</span>?
<!-- \pause -->
If a little medicine is good, then a lot of medicine must be even better. So use a second-degree polynomial, and try to find <span class="math">\( Y \)</span> of the form
<span class="math">\[
    Y(t) = At^2 e^{-2t}.    
\]</span></p>

<h3 id="theuseofthemethod">The use of the method</h3>

<p>For even mildly complicated functions <span class="math">\( g(t) \)</span> the equations that result quickly become intractable for hand calculation. Yet knowing the technique of guessing the form of <span class="math">\( Y \)</span> is useful, because a computer algebra system can be used to do the rest of the work of searching for the coefficients.</p>

<p>Once again I urge you to resist the impulse to memorize the table in the text with information about the degeneracies; just remember to increase the degree of the coefficient. It&#8217;s ok to memorize the table that appears in this presentation, though.</p>

<h3 id="comingattractions">Coming attractions</h3>

<p>Undetermined coefficients doesn&#8217;t work as nicely if the inhomogeneous term <span class="math">\( g(t) \)</span> isn&#8217;t a linear combination of products of polynomials, trig functions, and exponentials. For that reason, we must investigate a second method: <!--\textsc{-->variation of parameters.<!--}--></p>
