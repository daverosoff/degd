<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="introduction:thisonegoesouttoallthegs">Introduction: This one goes out to all the <span class="math">\( g \)</span>s</h3>

<p>The method of undetermined coefficients is very useful when the derivatives of the terms appearing in <span class="math">\( g(t) \)</span> have a regular, predictable shape and are themselves the derivatives of similar functions. But it&#8217;s not too hard to find functions <span class="math">\( g(t) \)</span> that would demand excessive ingenuity of us when guessing the form of <span class="math">\( Y \)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="introduction:toomanyfunctions">Introduction: Too many functions!</h3>

<p>Consider <span class="math">\( y'' + y' + y = 3 \csc{(t)} \)</span>. You can check that a particular solution <span class="math">\( Y \)</span> is given by the formula
<!-- \pause -->
<span class="math">\[
    -3 \sin{(t)} \cos{(2t)} + \frac{3}{2} \ln |\csc{(t)} - \cot{(t)}| \sin{(2t)} + 3 \cos{(t)} \sin{(2t)}.
\]</span>
<!-- \pause -->
It&#8217;s hard to imagine rules for undetermined coefficients that are both</p>

<ul>
<li>comprehensive enough to include a function like this and</li>
<li>possible to commit to memory.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="variationofparameters">Variation of parameters</h2>

<h3 id="variationofparameters:notanewthought">Variation of parameters: not a new thought</h3>

<p>Recall how we discovered the second fundamental solution <span class="math">\( t e^{rt} \)</span> in the case of a repeated root <span class="math">\( r \)</span> of the characteristic equation. We promoted a constant to a functional coefficient and looked for a solution of the form <span class="math">\( v(t) \exp{(rt)} \)</span>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In other words, we allowed a parameter to vary.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can try a similar idea when tackling the inhomogeneous equation <span class="math">\( y'' + q(t)y' + r(t)y = g(t) \)</span>, provided we have already solved the associated homogeneous equation <span class="math">\( y'' + q(t)y' + r(t)y = 0 \)</span>. Let us write <span class="math">\( y_1 \)</span> and <span class="math">\( y_2 \)</span> for a fundamental set of solutions as usual.</p>

<h3 id="variationofparameters:execution">Variation of parameters: execution</h3>

<p>We shall search for a particular solution <span class="math">\( Y \)</span> of our inhomogeneous equation of the form <span class="math">\( Y = u_1 y_1 + u_2 y_2 \)</span>: that is to say,
<span class="math">\[
    Y(t) = u_1(t) y_1(t) + u_2(t) y_2(t),
\]</span>
where <span class="math">\( u_1 \)</span> and <span class="math">\( u_2 \)</span> are unknown coefficient functions we will have to find. We&#8217;ll be plugging this expression for <span class="math">\( Y \)</span> along with its derivatives back into the inhomogeneous equation, so let&#8217;s compute the derivatives now.</p>

<h3 id="anunjustifiedassumption">An unjustified assumption</h3>

<p>For no very good reason, let&#8217;s assume that the fundamental solutions <span class="math">\( y_1 \)</span> and <span class="math">\( y_2 \)</span> and the derivatives <span class="math">\( u'_1 \)</span> and <span class="math">\( u'_2 \)</span> satisfy the following equation:
<span class="math">\[
    u'_1 y_1 + u'_2 y_2  = 0.
\]</span></p>

<ul>
<li>This is the worst rabbit-out-of-the-hat of the term.</li>
<li>Sorry.</li>
<li>The idea is evidently due to Lagrange<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>, and it greatly simplifies the computation to come.</li>
<li>At no point does it cause problems of any kind.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="thederivativesofy">The derivatives of <span class="math">\( Y \)</span></h3>

<p>Since
<span class="math">\[
    Y(t) = u_1(t) y_1(t) + u_2(t) y_2(t),
\]</span>
we also have
<!--
\begin{align*}
    Y'  &= u'_1 y_1 + u_1 y'_1 + u'_2 y_2 + u_2 y'_2, \\
        &= u_1 y'_1 + u_2 y'_2, \quad \text{and so} \\
    Y'' &= u_1 y''_1 + u'_1 y'_1 + u'_2 y'_2 + u_2 y''_2.
\end{align*}
--></p>

<h3 id="substitutebackin">Substitute back in</h3>

<p>Now we find that <span class="math">\( Y''(t) + q(t)Y'(t) + r(t)Y(t) \)</span> reduces to
<span class="math">\[
    (u_1 y''_1 + u'_1 y'_1 + u'_2 y'_2 + u_2 y''_2) + q(t)(u_1 y'_1 + u_2 y'_2) + r(t)(u_1 y_1 + u_2 y_2).
\]</span>
Collecting terms along <span class="math">\( u_1 \)</span>, <span class="math">\( u_2 \)</span>, and their derivatives, we get
<!-- 
\begin{align*}
    (y''_1  & + qy'_1 + ry_1)u_1 + (y''_2 + qy'_2 + ry_2)u_2 + y'_1 u'_1 + y'_2 u'_2 \\
    &= y'_1 u'_1 + y'_2 u'_2,
\end{align*}
 -->
because of the assumption <span class="math">\( u'_1 y_1 + u'_2 y_2  = 0 \)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="puttingitalltogether">Putting it all together</h3>

<p>We have shown that if <span class="math">\( u_1 \)</span> and <span class="math">\( u_2 \)</span> have the desired properties, then they satisfy
<!-- \begin{align*}
    u'_1 y'_1 + u'_2 y'_2 &= g(t) \\
    u'_1 y_1 + u'_2 y_2  &= 0.
\end{align*}
 -->
Solving this system of equations for <span class="math">\( u_1 \)</span> and <span class="math">\( u_2 \)</span> (in the usual algebraic way, by either substitution or addition of equations)
gives
<span class="math">\[
    u'_1 = -\frac{y_2 g}{W(y_1, y_2)}, u'_2 = \frac{y_1 g}{W(y_1, y_2)}.
\]</span>
Integrating each of these yields the desired functions <span class="math">\( u_1 \)</span> and <span class="math">\( u_2 \)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<h3 id="theparticularsolution">The particular solution</h3>

<p>That is, a particular solution <span class="math">\( Y \)</span> results from any choice of antiderivatives <span class="math">\( u_1 \)</span>, <span class="math">\( u_2 \)</span>. We have
<span class="math">\[
    Y = -y_1 \int \frac{y_2 g}{W(y_1, y_2)} \; dt + y_2 \int \frac{y_1 g}{W(y_1, y_2)} \; dt.
\]</span>
Like undetermined coefficients, this method has its own characteristics.</p>

<ul>
<li>It is reassuringly mechanistic. <span class="math">\( Y \)</span> is given by a formula.</li>
<li>It is also very general, since there are no conditions on <span class="math">\( g \)</span>.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the integrals that arise may be intractable.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="generalizations">Generalizations</h3>

<p>For us, the coefficient functions <span class="math">\( q(t) \)</span> and <span class="math">\( r(t) \)</span> are constant. What happens when they are not?</p>

<ul>
<li>The methods of Chapter 5 are required to solve the general second-order linear homogeneous equation.</li>
<li>If fundamental solutions are known, VP works just the same to determine a particular solution.</li>
<li>It is only the characteristic equation and the exponential trick that fail in this case.</li>
</ul>

<p>Joseph-Louis Lagrange (25 January 1736&#8211;10 April 1813) is most remembered for contributions analysis, number theory, and classical and celestial mechanics.
