<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

<h3 id="thehomogeneouscase">The homogeneous case</h3>

<p>In the last couple weeks, we saw how to use the exponential trick and some inspired guessing to get general solutions of the general second-order linear homogeneous equation with constant coefficients,
<span class="math">\[ ay'' + by' + cy = 0. \]</span></p>

<p>There were three distinct cases, corresponding to the three different possibilities <span class="math">\( D = b^2 - 4ac > 0 \)</span>, <span class="math">\( D < 0 \)</span>, and <span class="math">\( D = 0 \)</span>.</p>

<h2 id="inhomogeneousequations">Inhomogeneous equations</h2>

<h3 id="inhomogeneity">Inhomogeneity</h3>

<p>One of the key algebraic coincidences that allowed us to use the exponential trick was the <em>superposition principle</em>. This is the principle that if <span class="math">\( y_1 \)</span> and <span class="math">\( y_2 \)</span> are solutions, then all their linear combinations are too. It fails spectacularly if we try it on an inhomogeneous equation, as illustrated in several weekly homework problems.</p>

<h3 id="inhomogeneity:thetranslationprinciple">Inhomogeneity: the translation principle</h3>

<p>But this doesn&#8217;t mean that our work on the homogeneous equation won&#8217;t help us solve equations of the form
<!--
\begin{equation} \label{eq:inhom}
ay'' + by' + cy = g(t).
\end{equation}
-->
This is because any two solutions of such an equation differ by a solution of the <em>associated homogeneous equation</em> <span class="math">\( ay'' + by' + cy = 0 \)</span>. That is to say, if <span class="math">\( Y_1 \)</span> and <span class="math">\( Y_2 \)</span> are both solutions of Equation<!--~\ref{eq:inhom}-->, then <span class="math">\( Y_1 - Y_2 \)</span> is a solution of the associated homogeneous equation.</p>

<h3 id="thegeometryoflineardifferentialoperators:homogeneousequations">The geometry of linear differential operators: homogeneous equations</h3>

<p>It is best to think of the whole collection of solutions of the associated homogeneous equation as a set<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> <span class="math">\( S \)</span>. A pair of fundamental solutions <span class="math">\( y_1 \)</span>, <span class="math">\( y_2 \)</span> matches <span class="math">\( S \)</span> with the Euclidean plane; namely, the point <span class="math">\( (c_1, c_2) \)</span> corresponds to the solution <span class="math">\( c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2 \)</span>. Practice visualizing the plane as embedded in a bigger-dimensional space (the space of all differentiable functions, maybe).</p>

<p>Observe that the point <span class="math">\( (0,0) \)</span> is an element of our plane <span class="math">\( S \)</span>, because the zero function is a solution of every homogeneous differential equation. Thus the plane you are imagining passes through the origin of whatever space it lives in.</p>

<h3 id="thegeometryoflineardifferentialoperators:inhomogeneousequations">The geometry of linear differential operators: inhomogeneous equations</h3>

<p>Since the inhomogeneous equation <span class="math">\( ay'' + by' + cy = g(t) \)</span> is a second-order equation, intuition and the theory of Wronskians tell us that there should be a pair of fundamental solutions. This sort of happens, but the details are a little different.
<!--
\begin{block}{The solutions are still a plane}
Solutions of the inhomogeneous equation correspond to points in a plane just like the solutions of the homogeneous equation do. The difference is, it's not the same plane.
\end{block}
-->
The plane for inhomogeneous equations doesn&#8217;t pass through the origin, because the zero function isn&#8217;t a solution of any inhomogeneous equation.</p>

<h3 id="thegeometryoflineardifferentialoperators:particularsolutions">The geometry of linear differential operators: particular solutions</h3>

<p>Recall the translation principle for the inhomogeneous equation:
<!--
\begin{block}{Translation principle}
If $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are solutions of the inhomogeneous equation, then their difference $Y_1 - Y_2$ is a solution of the associated homogeneous equation.
\end{block}
-->
Inverted, it tells us how to construct new solutions of the inhomogeneous equation from a previously known one: add solutions of the associated homogeneous equation.</p>

<h3 id="thegeneralsolutionoftheinhomogeneousequation">The general solution of the inhomogeneous equation</h3>

<p>Let us suppose that by some devious method we have constructed a single solution of the inhomogeneous equation, say <span class="math">\( Y \)</span>, so that <span class="math">\( aY'' + bY' + cY = g(t) \)</span>. Let also <span class="math">\( y_1 \)</span> and <span class="math">\( y_2 \)</span> be a fundamental set of solutions of the associated homogeneous equation.
<!--
\begin{block}{General solution of the inhomogeneous equation}
Every function satisfying $ay'' + by' + cy = g(t)$ is of the form
\[ Y + c_1y_1 + c_2 y_2 \]
for some numbers $c_1$ and $c_2$.
\end{block}
-->
Thus these solutions also form a plane: a plane passing through the nonzero point <span class="math">\( Y \)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="constructionofparticularsolutions">Construction of particular solutions</h3>

<p>As usual, this existence theorem doesn&#8217;t tell us anything about how to construct <span class="math">\( Y \)</span>, called a <em>particular solution</em> of the equation. We know from the general existence theorem for second-order initial value problems that each has a solution. Methods for finding <span class="math">\( Y \)</span> vary and depend very much on the form of the inhomogeneous term <span class="math">\( g(t) \)</span>. We will investigate two such methods: the first of these is <em>undetermined coefficients</em>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<h3 id="conclusion:examplesgoodtablebad">Conclusion: examples good, table bad</h3>

<p>By clever guessing with sufficient algebraic stamina, it&#8217;s possible to build <span class="math">\( Y \)</span> in a reasonably systematic and efficient way when <span class="math">\( g(t) \)</span> is, roughly speaking, built from polynomials, exponential functions, and sine and cosine. But I have one warning to give you.<!--

It is, very probably, a big mistake to try to memorize the table given in the text. I&#8217;ve watched people try and fail for years. It is a much better idea to learn the mental yoga of how the method works, by working through and thinking about lots of examples.</p>
