<li>Assigned Monday, February 18. Read section 2.2 and skim section 2.3. You can <a href="SeparationOfVariables.sws">download</a> Monday&#8217;s in-class Sage worksheet; ignore everything after the command consisting only of a zero. You&#8217;ll need to save the <em class = "code"><!--\texttt{-->.sws<!--}--></em> file to disk. Then, you can upload into your own Sage notebook. See the <a href="sage.html">Getting Started worksheet</a> for more.

<ul>
<li>Section 2.2: Exercises 1&#8211;8 (all exercises) and 9&#8211;15 odd.</li>

<ul>
<li>Assigned Friday, February 15. Read section 2.1 and skim section 2.2.

<ul>
<li>Section 2.1: Exercises 1&#8211;5 and 16. To produce the plots, I suggest you make use of <a href="sage.html">Sage</a>. In solving the differential equations themselves, you&#8217;ll need to make heavy use of integration by parts.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assigned Wednesday, February 13. Read section 2.1.

<ul>
<li>Section 1.3: Exercises 7&#8211;9, 11, 12, 14. Work done in <a href="sage.html">Sage</a> is fine (except 14), but if you feel you are a little rusty with integrals, you could probably use the practice of doing these by hand. If some of the functions involved look unfamiliar, Google them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assigned Monday, February 11. Read Chapter 1. You&#8217;re invited to download <a href="SlopeFields.sws">this Sage worksheet</a> and open it at the public <a href="http://www.sagenb.org/">Sage notebook server</a> (registration required) to experiment with slope fields. See: <a href="sage.html">Getting Started with Sage</a>.

<ul>
<li>Section 1.1: Exercises 15&#8211;20, 21, 22.</li>
<li>Section 1.2: Exercises 5&#8211;8, 12&#8211;14.</li>

<ul>
<li>Section 2.5: 15. I encourage you to make use of Sage, although this problem should not be as challenging as some of the 2.3 problems to do by hand. It will help a lot if you think about part (a) in verbal context. What is the meaning of <span class="math">\(K\)</span>? What is the meaning of <span class="math">\(\tau\)</span>? How do <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span>, etc., correspond to numbers in part (a)?
