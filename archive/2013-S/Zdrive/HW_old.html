        <li class = "problems">Assigned Wednesday, February 27. Complete the <a href = "GWModeling_M352_S13.pdf">activity problems from in-class</a> to be handed in Friday in lieu of Quiz 4. No new daily problems from the text. Read section 2.5.</li>
        <li class = "problems">Assigned Monday, February 25. Read section 2.4 and skim 2.5. Work exercises 2.4.1&ndash;2.4.6, 2.4.7, 2.4.8. No quiz Wednesday.</li>

    <h4>Week 2: February 18&ndash;22</h4>
    <ul>
        <li class = "problems">Assigned Friday, February 22. Read section 2.3 and skim section 2.4. Work exercises 2.3.1&ndash;2.3.10.</li>
        <li class = "problems">Assigned Wednesday, February 20. Exercises from class: 2.2.12, 22, 24, 28. Daily homework is to use Sage or another computer algebra system to plot the solutions to the IVPs. Use the plots to answer the questions about max/min and domains of solutions.</li>
        <li class = "problems">Assigned Monday, February 18. Read section 2.2 and skim section 2.3. Work exercises 2.2.1&ndash;2.2.8 (all exercises) and 2.2.9&ndash;2.2.15 odd. You can <a href = "SeparationOfVariables.sws">download</a> Monday's in-class Sage worksheet; ignore everything after the command consisting only of a zero. You'll need to save the <em class = "code">.sws</em> file to disk. Then, you can upload into your own Sage notebook. See the <a href = "sage.html">Getting Started worksheet</a> for more.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Week 1: February 11&ndash;15</h4>
    <ul>
        <li class = "problems">Assigned Friday, February 15. Read section 2.1 and skim section 2.2. Work exercises 2.1.1&ndash;2.1.5 and 2.1.16. To produce the plots, I suggest you make use of <a href = "sage.html">Sage</a>. In solving the differential equations themselves, you'll need to make heavy use of integration by parts.</li>
        <li class = "problems">Assigned Wednesday, February 13. Read section 2.1. Work exercises 1.3.7&ndash;9, 11, 12, 14. Work done in <a href = "sage.html">Sage</a> is fine (except 14), but if you feel you are a  little rusty with integrals, you could probably use the practice of doing these by hand. If some of the functions involved look unfamiliar, Google them.</li>
        <li class = "problems">
            Assigned Monday, February 11. Read Chapter 1. Work exercises 1.1.15&ndash;20, 21, 22; 1.2.5&ndash;8, 12&ndash;14. You're invited to download <a href = "SlopeFields.sws">this Sage worksheet</a> and open it at the public <a href = "http://www.sagenb.org/">Sage notebook server</a> (registration required) to experiment with slope fields. See: <a href = "sage.html">Getting Started with Sage</a>.

Put some effort into understanding the problem before you begin to solve it.</li>
