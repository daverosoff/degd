<h2>Final Exam, Sage component (version $\delta$)</h2>
<h4>Instructions</h4>
<p>Use your knowledge of Sage to complete the tasks, working directly in this Sage worksheet. You can refer to any saved
Sage code you have access to. Budget your time wisely.</p>
<p>Try to keep your layout clean. Your solution should be linear and readable. Remember,
    to add explanation, you can make a text cell by making the first line read <tt>%html</tt>.</p>
<p>When you are finished, download this worksheet and rename the file <tt>lastname-firstname-final.sagews</tt>. Email the renamed file to <tt>drosoff@collegeofidaho.edu</tt>.</p>
<p><font color="red">Do not modify your file after the exam ends until you receive confirmation that I have an uncorrupted copy. We need to keep your version timestamped before the end of the hour.</font></p>

<h4>Question 1</h4>
<p>Use Sage to produce a phase portrait (including vector field and at least 2 trajectories) for the following differential equation:</p>
\begin{equation*}
    \vec{x}' = \begin{pmatrix}
        4 & 5 \\
        0 & -1
    \end{pmatrix} \vec{x}.
\end{equation*}

<h4>Question 2</h4>
<p>Use Sage to produce a phase portrait for the real-valued solutions that come from the
eigenvalues $r_1 = -4i$, $r_2 = 4i$, with corresponding eigenvectors</p>
\begin{equation*}
    \vec{\xi}_1 = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \\ 2-4i
    \end{pmatrix}, \quad \vec{\xi}_2 = \begin{pmatrix}
        1 \\ 2+4i
    \end{pmatrix}
